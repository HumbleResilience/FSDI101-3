            <p class="firstp">Hello everyone, to start with My Bio, I was born and raised in a small town called Jonesboro in Arkansas. 
            I joined the Army when I was 21, and I served 6 years as an IT Specialist before getting out. I then went to college for <i>Automotive Technology.</i> 
            Fast forward to the present day, I work at a PC repair shop currently. In other news, I can't wait until I become a web developer, its exciting!
